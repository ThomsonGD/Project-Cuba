# Project Cuba (Name TBC)

### Introduction
Project Cuba (Name TBC) is a futuristic action-adventure game that is set in massive open world city. It is presented from a third-person perspective showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be rotated freely around it. The who can navigate the world by walking, grappling hook, and fast travel. Personal vehicles will be added later, this is due to the complex nature of hover cars.

## Game Features

### Combat
Enacted using projectile weapons, melee weapons, grenades. Non-lethal weapons can be used to incapacitate enemies, immediately removing them from battle. Successful and consecutive attacks build "Focus", with full "Focus" this allows the player to access a powerful special finishing attack to take down an enemy instantly. Player possesses "augmented senses", which is shown as a red threat icon above the character's head, indicating an incoming attack that can be dodged. A precise dodge performed just before the attack hits allows player to retaliate with an attack against the enemy. Some enemies must be overcome using different approaches. Melee-weapon-wielding enemies must be knocked into the air and shielded enemies must be attacked from behind. Enemies armed with whips will drag player out of the air and require a counterattack to fight effectively. Other types of enemy include heavily armoured agents who can take more damage, brutes, and jetpack-wearing enemies who remain airborne.

### Gameplay
Some sections of the game are played involving puzzle-solving while other areas are focused on the using stealth to avoid enemies. The game will feature four difficulty levels; Friendly (easy), Amazing (normal), and Spectacular (Hard) and "Ultimate" difficulty that increases enemy damage and health while decreasing player's, and a "New Game Plus" option that allows the player to start a new game using all of the the cradle exosuits, augmentations, powers, gadgets, and suit mods unlocked in a previous play-through. There is also a photo mode that allows the player to take pictures of player using a variety of image filters, frames, and stickers for customisation. The camera can be used to take selfies and can be freely moved around player to capture him in action.

### Progression
Player has access to a variety of augmentations and gadgets that can be deployed in combat; these include electric grappling hook, concussive blasts, and an impact cannon that launches enemies backwards to give the player time to attack. Gadgets are unlocked by progressing through the game and can be accessed from a radial menu. The player has several unlock-able cradle exosuits that are based on different combat styles. Many of these offer special abilities that can aid in combat, such as increasing Focus gain, reducing gravity, enhancing stealth, making the player invulnerable, and unleashing an electromagnetic pulse to disable enemy weapons. Once unlocked, the exosuits and powers can be freely combined. Stealth combat involves player moving around raised locations using gadgets or grappling hook to neutralise isolated enemies. Levelling up allows the player to unlock skills from three different specialties, focusing on ground combat, aerial combat, and traversal.
Exosuits, augmentations, suit mods, gadgets, and they're associated upgrades are purchased with resources called Tokens, which are awarded for completion of specific tasks. Each unlock-able item requires different quantities of each Token type: Challenge Tokens for completing Taskmaster's time-and-skill based combat, stealth, and traversal missions; Exosuits crates, Tokens for locating player's old exeosuit crates. Research Tokens for completing research station missions, science mini-games; Crime Tokens for stopping ambient crimes; Base Tokens for clearing out enemy bases; There are also mini-games that are rewarded with experience points and research tokens including pattern puzzles that require the recreation of a specific pattern using composite parts. Comms towers in different areas can be unscrambled, highlighting collectable objects, missions, and active crimes.
